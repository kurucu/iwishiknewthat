# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

This public project aims to provide an insight to all the things we're not taught at school but that are big aspects of every day life.

Every topic has an easy to read introduction, so you can skim through and see why it might be important to read more. If you want to follow up, the principles of the topic are discussed and resources either provided or linked to.

We're not aiming to reproduce the excellent tools available around the world, but instead provide an easy index to get you started.

The site should suit anyone from the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia or New Zealand and probably many more. Where local knowledge is important, we try to highlight that.
